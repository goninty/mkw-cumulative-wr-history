# MKW Cumulative WR History

Cumulative WR history scrapings from mkwrs.com for use in data visualisations.

All of the code in this (especially all of the Processing animation type stuff) is very, *very* bad. Please do not look at it.

For context, this was written just to produce the line graph animation just so that I could screen capture it once and then edit it into a nice video. It's not meant to be sustainable or maintainable code.
